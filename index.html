    <h1>CS7301 Project</h1>
    <p>This page links to all needed sources needed for our project</p>
    <p>Our code was developed in Google Colab, file included in the GitHub. To run, only need to run the Google Colab notebook, will likely take a long time to run all the way through.</p>
    <p>Make sure to pip install everything we have in our code. After installing spacy, allennnlp, and allennlp_models, you may be prompted to restart your session in order to properly update the libraries. Do so if asked. Run the import code block. Then run the AllenNLP predictor download. If you get an error from this not recognizing one of the packages, then you need to start your session over and pip install everything again until it works.

Now you are past the tricky part. You can run the rest of the code blocks without issue. The "Parse Dataset with Stanza and Save to File" section runs for a couple hours so do not be alarmed if it doesn't stop running after a couple minutes. It just takes this long to go through all of the entries from the dataset. You can continue to run everything else.

We have all of this demonstrated in our demo video in case you cannot run it for multiple hours.</p>
